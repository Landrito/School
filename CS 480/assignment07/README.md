PA7 Solar System 
===========================================

General Information
--------------------

This program uses an ASSIMP model and texture loader to load a scale version of the Solar System in openGL.

Planets have satellites orbiting them.
The scale of the planets can be seen by selecting the Sun as the target of the camera. 

Controls
----------
It is possible to zoom to each planet and see them all in the same scale by moving through the planets '1-9'

Keyboard:
0-9:  Will lock the camera onto that number of planet ( 0 is the Sun, 1 is Mercury, ..., 9 is Pluto )
