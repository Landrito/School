Short Answer:
What is an advantage of using a homogeneous-coordinate system?

1. All affine transformations can be represented as matrix multiplications in homogeneous coordinates.
2. Less arithmetic work is involved when using homogeneous-coordinate systems.
3. The Uniformity of the affine transformations makes carrying out successive transformations far easier than in three dimensional space.
